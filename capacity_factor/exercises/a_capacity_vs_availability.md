AF can never be equal to CF ($AF<CF$) because no reactor can reach maximum
(design) power instantaneously. In research reactors, max power may be reached
in a few minutes (starting from shutdown condition); in commercial reactors,
the prestart tests (at various ascending power levels), required by NRC
regulations,take at least a day.
