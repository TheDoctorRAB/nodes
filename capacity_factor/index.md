# Capacity Factor 

The capacity factor is representative of the plant's tendency to acheive its rated power capacity.

\[
CF &= \frac{\mbox{actual power generated over time T}}{\mbox{rated power potential over time T}}\\
   &=\frac{\int_0^T P(t)dt}{P_0T}\\
P(t) &= \mbox{ thermal power at time t during period T}
\]
