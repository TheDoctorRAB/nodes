# NECX: Nuclear Engineering Curriculum eXchange

The Nuclear Engineering Curriculum eXchange (NECX) is a open repository for
nuclear engineering curriculum materials intentionally prepared for reuse,
remixing and rejeuvination.

Materials are bundled in small units called "Nodes", each of which is required
to contain:
* a title
* a unique short title (UID)
* a list of prerequisites based on the UIDs of other nodes
* learning objectives
* a content summary
* at least one assessment object

A node may also contain:
* course notes including equations
* example source code
* citations of other work
* external readings
* instructor guidance
* graphics
* videos (or links to video content)
* audio files (or links to audio content)
* worked example problems
* reference to ABET a-k objectives
* active learning activities including
    * demonstrations
    * code completion exercises
    * think pair share questions
    * etc
* additional assessment objects
