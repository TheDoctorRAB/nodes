Basic understanding of radioactive decay

<p>
Radioactive decay refers generally to the distinegration of an unstable nucleus to a stable state. Because we do not know the exact second that the nucleus will decay, we have to statistically model the decay process. Occurrences (decays) are randomly distributed in time. Therefore, we can use the Poisson process to characterize the mean time that a decay will occur.
</p>
<p>
The Poisson distribution just describes the probability of a given number of events, in our case, decays, that occur within a fixed time interval: $P(n) = e^{-/mu} /cdot \frac{/mu^{n}}{n!}$, and $/mu = \lambda \Delta t$, where $\lambda$ is defined as the decay constant which is what we really are most concerned about in nuclear science and engineering problems.

<p>
We really do not use the Poisson distribution per se, but we need to define the distribution in order to obtain the decay constant.
