# Formatting Assessment Activities

Assessment activities may take many formats, depending on the type of
assessment.  Some assessment types include:

* multiple choice questions
* Jupyter notebook problems
* short answer questions
* quantitative engineering problems

For eacch type, a standard format will be established to facilitate automated
processing and translation of these questions into final rendered formats.
These formats will be defined below.

To the extent possible, widely-adopted standard formats for representing
assessment activities will chosen for use here, rather than developing new
standard formats.
