# Definition of nuclear fuel burnup

Burnup is generally considered the best measure of the amount of time that
nuclear fuel has been irradiated in a reactor.  Time alone is not sufficient
because it does not incorporate the effects of irradiation that depend on the
power level.  Burnup is the integral of time dependent specifc power over a particular
period of time.

$$B = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} P(t') dt'$$
